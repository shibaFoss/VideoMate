/**
 * A simplified abstract implementation of [TextWatcher] to observe text changes in an EditText.
 *
 * This class provides default empty implementations for `beforeTextChanged` and `onTextChanged`,
 * so you only need to override and implement the `afterTextChanged` method.
 *
 * Use this listener when you're only interested in reacting to text changes **after** they occur.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * editText.addTextChangedListener(object : EditTextListener() {
 *     override fun afterTextChanged(editable: Editable) {
 *         // Handle updated text
 *     }
 * })
 * ```
