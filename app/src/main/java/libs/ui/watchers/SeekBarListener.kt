/**
 * An abstract implementation of [OnSeekBarChangeListener] that simplifies the usage of SeekBar listeners.
 *
 * This class provides default implementations for `onStartTrackingTouch` and `onStopTrackingTouch`,
 * so you only need to override and implement the `onProgressChange` method to handle progress updates.
 *
 * Use this listener when you only care about the progress change and want to avoid dealing with the
 * start and stop tracking events.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * seekBar.setOnSeekBarChangeListener(object : SeekBarListener() {
 *     override fun onProgressChange(seekBar: SeekBar?, progress: Int, fromUser: Boolean) {
 *         // Handle progress change
 *     }
 * })
 * ```
